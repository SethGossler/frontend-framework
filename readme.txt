#Frontend Framework
#--not too fancy, but just right --

This is a straight forward frontend framework. Utilizing require.js, it's made to organize
'Views' and 'Layouts'. 


Instructions to do in command line to get started:
1. npm install
2. bower instal
3. cd generator-frontend
4. npm link
5. cd ../
6. yo frontend
  6.a make a layout
  6.b make a view
7. gulp
8. Go to: http://localhost:3001/home-page/home-page.html -- for an example of this system.

Too add external libs (like stuff installed from bower or npm), add them  to the scripts.json file!
Found at src/libs/scripts.json

I've already included jquery.

Everything else should be taken care of. I think ...
